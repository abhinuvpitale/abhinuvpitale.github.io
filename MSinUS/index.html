        <a href="https://abhinuv.dev">Abhinuv Pitale</a>

        <p>The process of applying for admissions can be daunting and a tiring process which involves set of convulted steps and decisions which can be over-whelming. Even after arriving at the university of your choice, there are a loads of questions that you might have. As somebody who was in a similar state, I understand this confusion and would like to help you make that process easier.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        Despite the numerous materials available on the web, this process can be extremely different for everyone since each one of us has a different set of achievements, skills and hence a different SOP. However, in my opinon there is more to it than just a different SOP. Each one of us is applying from a very different viewpoint and hence needs advice that is tailored towards that.

        <br><br>
        This is a social experiment that I am going to try out, wherein in for advice, review and other such requests with respect to admissions, I will try to connect you with a person who has been on a similar path. 
        In exchange for her/his advice you would make a small donation to a charity of his/her choice. This donation serves the dual purpose of filtering out legit queries as well as reducing the number of questions and connections that I can make on the limited out of time that I have. 

        <br><br>
        Steps: 
        <br>
        1. Fill out this form so that I know what you sort of advice you are seeking. <a href="">Intake</a>
        <br>
        2. Based on what your request is, I will email you with contact and appointment(Skype, if required) details of the person and the charity of her/his choice.
        <br>
        3. I request you to make the donation before you contact the person.

	FAQS
	<br>
	<b>1. What are some things that I can ask advice on?</b>
	<br>
	Depeding on what stage in the application process you are you can ask various questions. You could ask about generic advice on SOP, LORs and Resumes. You could/should ask for advice on research oppurtinites. Ask about which professors are actively recruiting students. Most of the professors' websites are pretty out of date. This makes your application outdated, so this form might prove a useful oppurtinity to get the right information. 
	<br>
	<b>2. How will I get connected to the right person?</b>
	Currently, I am using a simple excel sheet to record and match you and your interests to somebody who(I personally know or is a second level connection of mine) has taken a similar path (similar research interests, same school, same background). While filling the intake form, you could mention if you want any specific requests and I will try to arrange for the same.
	<br>
	<b>3. Why do this? </b>
	There are a lot of resources online, various classes and guidance programs for selecting a right school. However, based on my personal expereince and from what I have discussed with a lot of folks who attended them, I have come to a conclusion (which is just my opinon and might not be universally true - )
	<br>
	Most of the classes which recommend a university do it solely based on your GRE score which seems like an incorrect thing to do, since a Masters degree is usally more than just academics. The best way to gain a wholesome experience for Masters would be if your expectations, your interests are in line with the school you choose, the program you attend. professors you collaborate and the courses you attend. 
	<br>
	I made a decision on my school after talking to a lot of seniors in various schools and I think it personally helped me make the right choice. Furthermore, their opinion helped me pick the right track for grad school which made my master's journey fulfilling, exciting and less cumbersome that it could have been! 
	<br>
	<b>4. Contribution questions</b>
	I think the contribution guidelines enforces a good filter on the amount of queries that I can answer, and it also makes everyone who is giving advice to put in their best effort in helping out. It also serves as a good inititive to return to this forum and keep helping those juniors out. However if you think the amount is too high, or for some reason you are not able to meet it, do mention so in the form, and I would still try my best to help you out.
