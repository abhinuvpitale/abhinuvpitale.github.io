        <br><br>

        The process of applying for admissions can be daunting and a tiring process which involves set of convulted steps and decisions which can be over-whelming. Even after arriving at the university of your choice, there are a loads of questions that you might have. As somebody who was in a similar state, I understand this confusion and would like to help you make that process easier.
        

        <br><br>
        Despite the numerous materials available on the web, this process can be extremely different for everyone since each one of us has a different set of achievements, skills and hence a different SOP. However, in my opinon there is more to it than just a different SOP. Each one of us is applying from a very different viewpoint and hence needs advice that is tailored towards that.

        <br><br>
        This is a social experiment that I am going to try out, wherein in for advice, review and other such requests with respect to admissions, I will try to connect you with a person who has been on a similar path. 
        In exchange for her/his advice you would make a small donation to a charity of his/her choice. This donation serves the dual purpose of filtering out legit queries as well as reducing the number of questions and connections that I can make on the limited out of time that I have. 

        <br><br>
        What are some queries we can help/advice you on?
        <br>
        - SOP/LOR reviews<br>
        - University Coursework/ Research oppurtinities<br>
        - RA/TA options, Scholarships<br>
        - Finance related questions
        <br><br>
        Steps: 
        <br>
        1. Fill out this form so that I know what you sort of advice you are seeking. <b><a style="color:red" href="https://forms.gle/Ln9AFYu62fiN8PzH8">Intake</a></b>
        <br>
        2. Based on what your request is, I will email you with contact and appointment(Skype, if required) details of the person and the charity of her/his choice.
        <br>
        3. I request you to make the donation before you contact the person.
