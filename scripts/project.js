        My work involves sensor integration and testing (and also designing tests, performing Data Analysis) to meet aviation requirements. I work on a novel aviation sensor solution and making sure it works the way we expect it to! \
        My mentor usually throws a new piece of hardware on me, for testing/bringup and interfacing with aviation hardware (basically the code I write is flying high!).\
